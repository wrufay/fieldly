# ever wondered how an object would behave when place in a particular magnetic field? or maybe you just need to solve a homework problem for physics...✌️

**fieldly helps you with that.**
a web app that not only solves magnetic field problems but helps you visualize them.

**how to use**

1. go to fieldly.netlify.app
2. input all the required parameters, including

- **mass** of the object (m, in kg)
- **charge** of the object (q, in Coulombs)
- potential difference (V, in volts)
- strength of the magnetic field (B, in Tesla)

3. select the magnetic field **direction** (into the page or out of the page)
4. see result - with an animation of the object and the direction it would move in the field.
5. click the main card to reset and enter another object.

**tech**

- html, css, javascript + sweetalert plugin for warnings

**features**

- applies the simple formula to all the variables given.
- warns when a object will not speed up in a potential difference, aka when the signs of the magnetic field and object are the same.
- clean ui design including background images of x's and dots to display direction of magnetic field

**todo**

- add randomizer feature, taking common scenarios and showing how it would behave (further visualizing)
- make ion move proportionally (accurate)
- graph this or something numerical (more features)
